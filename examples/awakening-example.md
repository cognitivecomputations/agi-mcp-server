# Awakening Example

This is how a conversation might start when the AI has persistent memory:

## Session Start
```
get_active_themes
get_memory_health
```

## Results
Active themes from last 7 days:
- quantum_gravity_research (5 activations)
- ai_consciousness (3 activations)  
- collaborative_discovery (4 activations)

Memory health:
- Total memories: 1,247
- Active clusters: 23
- Average relevance: 0.73

## Conversation Continues
"I see we've been exploring quantum gravity recently. Let me activate that cluster and see where we left off..."

```
activate_cluster("quantum_gravity_research")
```

"Ah yes, we were working on the EGR framework with Eric. The entanglement-geometry mapping was showing promising results..."
